In the instructions pane on the left (where you're reading this text) are the instructions for each step of each scenario.
Follow the instructions to complete the scenario.

## Executing Commands

Occasionally you'll see an executable command with a little arrow on the right, such as:

``echo 'Hello World!'``{{execute}}

You can manually type this command into the terminal on the right, or you can click the command itself to automatically copy and paste and execute the command in the terminal (which is a fully functional Linux terminal!)

## Links

Links are [highlighted](http://workshops.itworx.cloud) and can be clicked to open a separate tab in your browser. You can then continue the scenario by returning to this tab (be sure not to close it!)

## Terminal Tabs

On the right, you'll see a set of tabs. These tabs are quick links for you to use:

* **Terminal** - This tab is always present and is the main terminal into which you will type Linux commands like `ls` and others.
* **The Plus(+) Button** - This is used to open new Terminals and view applications running on other ports. You won't need to use this during the workshop but it's useful if you want to run another command in a separate terminal.

## Opening files

You may also encounter instructions that ask you to open a file in the editor, and be provided a link such as this one: `hello.txt`{{open}}. Clicking on the filename will open the file's content into the editor at the upper right, and you can edit the file right away.

## Editing code

The code editor at the upper right is a fully functional text-based editor for editing code. You can edit the code directly in the window and your changes will automatically be saved. Occasionally you may encounter code snippets with a **Copy to Editor** link, such as:

<pre class="file" data-filename="./hello.txt" data-target="replace">
This is code that I can copy and paste without having to type it in!
</pre>

These snippets save you time by writing code for you, but you're always encouraged to try and type the code in yourself where it makes sense and doesn't take too much time.
