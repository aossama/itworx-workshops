The ```git fetch``` command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. Fetching 
is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on.

## Task

To get data from your remote projects, you can run `git fetch <remote>`.

The command goes out to that remote project and pulls down all the data from that remote project that you donâ€™t have 
yet. After you do this, you should have references to all the branches from that remote, which you can merge in or 
inspect at any time.
