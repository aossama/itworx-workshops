The most important takeaways from this lab are:

* `git clone` is used to create a copy of a target repo
* `git remote` is used to create, view, and delete connections to other repositories
* `git push` is used to propagate changes on the local repository to remote repository
* `git fetch` is used to download objects and refs from another repository
* `git pull` is used to fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
