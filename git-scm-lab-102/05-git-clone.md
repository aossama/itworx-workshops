If a project has already been set up in a central repository, the ```git clone``` command is the most common way for users to obtain a development copy. Like ```git init```, cloning is generally a one-time operation. Once a developer has obtained a working copy, all version control operations and collaborations are managed through their local repository.

The ```git clone``` clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository (visible using ```git branch -r```), and creates and checks out an initial branch that is forked from the cloned repository's currently active branch.
