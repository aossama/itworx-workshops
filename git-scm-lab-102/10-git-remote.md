The ```git remote``` command lets you create, view, and delete connections to other repositories. Remote connections are more like bookmarks rather than direct links into other repositories.

## Task

### Viewing git remote configurations

To list the remote connections you have to other repositories
```git remote```{{execute}}

Same as the above command, but include the URL of each connection.
```git remote -v```{{execute}}
