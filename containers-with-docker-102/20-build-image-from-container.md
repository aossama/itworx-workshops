Docker makes it easy to develop and deploy custom and consistent environments that include specific applications and dependencies.

Lets run a new container for webserver which we will edit to have our customized image:

```docker container run -d --name webserver -p 8000:80 nginx:latest```{{execute}}

After creating the container, we need to attach to it in order to make some changes, type this command:

```docker container exec -it webserver /bin/bash```{{execute}}

To visualize the changes, lets edit the welcome page of nginx to be "Welcome from our server":

```echo "Welcome from our server" > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html```{{execute}}

Type ```exit```{{execute}} to get out of the container, and go to the URL https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

### Commit Changes to the Image

Next, save the container as an image with the docker commit command:

```docker container commit webserver new-webserver```{{execute}}

If you run the docker images command, youâ€™ll see the new image, new-webserver listed.

### Tag Your Image for Version Control

When you pull down an image from Docker Hub, the Status line includes the image tag as shown here:

Status: Downloaded newer image for nginx:latest

Docker tags are an easy way for you to know what version or release you are working with. This is especially useful for creating new images from a base image. For example, if you have a Ubuntu image you use as a base to create different images, Docker tags help you track the differences:

* new-webserver:v1.8.10.2017
* new-webserver:v2.8.10.2017
* new-webserver:v3.8.10.2017

Create image tags with a docker commit. Using the example tags above, tag the new image with a version number and date:

```docker image tag new-webserver new-webserver:v1.8.10.2017```{{execute}}

Inspect the images with ```docker images```{{execute}} to see the new image created along with the associated tag. Notice that because these two images have the exact same content they have the same `IMAGE ID`.

### Share Images Docker Hub

In order to share images on Docker Hub, you have to signup for an account on https://hub.docker.com/ first.

Before pushing the image to Docker Hub, add a description, your full name (FULL NAME in the example here), and Docker Hub username (USERNAME) in the docker commit:

```docker commit -m "Added new web Server" -a "FULL NAME" webserver <USERNAME>/new-webserver-template:v1.8.10.2017```{{execute}}

Once this is fully tagged, log in and push it to Docker Hub:

You will be prompted for your Docker Hub credentials. When authentication succeeds, you will see Login succeeded. Now, you can push the image to the Hub with the command:

```docker push new-websrver-template:v1.8.10.2017```{{execute}}

Open a browser, log in to your Docker Hub account, and go your main repository. You will see the new image listed. Click on the image and then click on the Tags tab to see the added tag.
