As modern application requirements become more complex, it's apparent that one runtime, one framework, or one architectural style is no longer a feasible strategy. Organizations must figure out how to manage the complexity of distributed app development with diverse technologies, a lack of skilled resources, and siloed processes.

In this scenario you will get familiar with the environment for the rest of this course and how to use various command line interfaces (CLIs) that will be used throughout this course, such as Git (git) and Docker (docker). This will prepare you for the rest of Application and Delivery Modernization scenarios.

## The Environment

During this training course you will be using a hosted environment that is created just for you. This environment is not shared with other users of the system. The workshops are split into several scenarios, each of which focuses on a specific area related to Application Modernization and Transformation. Each scenario in turn has a number of steps that you follow to complete the scenario.
