Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers. The use of Linux containers to deploy applications is called _containerization_. Containers are not new, but their use for easily deploying applications is.

Containerization is increasingly popular because containers are:

* Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
* Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel.
* Interchangeable: You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly.
* Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
* Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas.
* Stackable: You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly.

In this lab you will run a popular, free, lightweight containers and explore the basics of how containers work, how the Docker Engine executes and isolates containers from each other. If you already have experience running containers and basic Docker commands you can probably skip this intro exercise.
