The most important takeaways from this lab are:

* `git checkout` can be used to create branches, switch branches, and checkout remote branches
* `git branch` commands primary functions are to create, list, rename and delete branches
* `git tag` is used to create semantic version number identifier tags that correspond to software release cycles
* `git merge` is used to combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history
* `git rebase`
* `git reset`
